# u-blox Wi-Fi driver
The Wi-Fi driver provides functionality to initialize, configure and manage a Wireless LAN connection using the ODIN-W2 module. A supplicant is included to enable authentication and encryption handling.

The Wi-Fi support conforms to IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n and has dual-band 2.4 GHz and 5GHz operation. The driver can either operate as a Station or an Access Point.

The Wi-Fi driver is typically used together with a TCP/IP stack. For the ODIN-W2 drivers we have added two additional yotta modules that holds the [lwIP stack](https://github.com/u-blox/sal-stack-lwip-ublox-odin-w2) and an [adaptation layer](https://github.com/u-blox/ublox-odin-w2-lwip-adapt). There is also a [Wi-Fi example](https://github.com/u-blox/mbed-examples-odin-w2/tree/master/udp-time-client-wifi) that shows how to use all three modules.

## General initialization
The Wi-Fi driver is initialized with a call to cbMAIN\_initWlan. Note that cbWLAN\_init must not be called since this is done from inside cbMAIN\_initWlan.

In order to get status updates it's necessary to register via the cbWLAN\_registerStatusCallback function.

Once the driver has been initialized and a status handler been registered it can be started with cbMAIN\_startWlan. When starting is finished a status event/callback is received.

If the driver is not intended to be in use anymore it is wise to stop it with cbWLAN\_Stop to lower power consumption.

## Station mode
The station mode is entered by calling any of the cbWLAN\_connectXXX functions. Whenever a connection is dropped the application will be notified and the driver will re-connect until a connection is reestablished. The connection can be cancelled or terminated by calling cbWLAN\_disconnect.

Although a scan is not neccessary prior to a connection establishment it might be required if full information about the access point is needed.

The sequence diagram below shows a typical scenario from an uninitialized driver to sending some socket data via the lwIP stack.

### 802.11r Wifi Roaming
Wifi roaming feature is supported for station mode and is enabled by default. Following parameters can be used to tune the roaming feature according to desired use case :

    cbTARGET_GSETTING_RSSI_GOOD                        , /**< When to abort scanning and initiate connection */
    cbTARGET_GSETTING_RSSI_BAD                         , /**< When to use BAD_RSSI_SCAN_YIELD_TIMEOUT for scanning between each channel for roaming */
    cbTARGET_GSETTING_GOOD_RSSI_SCAN_YIELD_TIMEOUT     , /**< Gap between each channel when doing background scan with a good connection */
    cbTARGET_GSETTING_BAD_RSSI_SCAN_YIELD_TIMEOUT      , /**< Gap between each channel when doing background scan with a bad connection */
    cbTARGET_GSETTING_ROAM_BLACKLIST_LAST_BSSID_TIMEOUT, /**< How long a new connection to the last connected AP should be banned */
    cbTARGET_GSETTING_ROAMING_AREA_HYSTERESIS,           /** Threshold between good and bad connection. */


## Access Point mode
The access point mode is entered by calling any of the cbWLAN_apStart* functions. Whenever a connection is established an event cbWLAN_STATUS_AP_ADDED is received. A corresponding cbLWAN_STATUS_AP_REMOVED is called when the station disconnects.

The sequence diagram below shows a typical scenario from an uninitialized driver to connected station. See wifi-ap test app for more info.
